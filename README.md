# Tictactics
**Overview**

Our project is to create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Players will select places on the board to put their X and try to get three in a row, while the program they play against will place O’s at random in free spaces on the board. If the program places three O’s in a row, the player loses. The program will use arrays and check if any lines on the board are completely filled with the same symbol, then check which symbol it is to see who has won. If the player wins, a point is added to their score. If there is a tie at the end of the game, it is repeated until there is a winner. The match will be a best of three, and the first to two points wins the game.

**Features**

2 players game.
One person is X, one person is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
Whoever succeeds in placing three marks on a line wins.
