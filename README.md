# Tictactics


**Overview**

Our project is to create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Players will select places on the board to put their X and try to get three in a row, while the program they play against will place O’s at random in free spaces on the board. If the program places three O’s in a row, the player loses. The program will use arrays and check if any lines on the board are completely filled with the same symbol, then check which symbol it is to see who has won. If the player wins, a point is added to their score. If there is a tie at the end of the game, it is repeated until there is a winner. The match will be a best of three, and the first to two points wins the game.

**Functional Requirements**

- User will pleace one of nine spaces on checkerboard with their symbol (which is X).
- Program will pick the next space to place it's symbol (which is O).
-
- After there is a winner, a scoreboard will appear on the side of the screen showing each player's points.
